## About

The _Shortbread_ vector tile schema is intended to be a basic, lean, general-purpose vector
tile schema for [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data.

It does not, and cannot, cover the full breadth and depth of OpenStreetMap tagging.

This website contains the description of the [Shortbread tile schema](/schema/), and instructions on how to [create Shortbread tiles](/make-vectortiles/).

Try it out with the [tile set of the German state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg (403 MB)](/shortbread-examples/shortbread-baden-wuerttemberg.mbtiles).

## History

Shortbread was initially made by [Geofabrik GmbH](https://www.geofabrik.de/) and is now a community project. Contributions are always welcome.

This schema documentation is published under the terms of the [CC-0 license](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/), generated using the Hugo framework, and the source is [on GitHub](https://github.com/geofabrik/shortbread-docs).

## Steering Committee

The job of the steering committee is to govern the Shortbread project, decide on strategic goals and implement them. This includes as its main job to shepherd the specification for the Shortbread Vector Tiles Schema.
